                            Consider first passage percolation on ${Z}^d$ with passage
                            times given by i.i.d. random variables with common distribution $F$.
                            Let $t_\pi(u,v)$ be the time from $u$ to $v$ for a path $\pi$ and
                            $t(u,v)$ the minimal time among all paths from $u$ to $v$. We
                            ask whether or not there exist points $x,y \in {Z}^d$ and a
                            semi-infinite path $\pi=(y_0=y,y_1,\dots)$ such that $t_\pi(y,
                            y_{n+1})<t(x,y_n)$ for all $n$. Necessary and sufficient conditions
                            on $F$ are given for this to occur. When the support of $F$ is unbounded, 
                            we also obtain results on the number of edges with large passage time used 
                            by geodesics. n results on the number of edges with large
                            passage time used by geodesics.

                        <p style='width:85%'> Abstract: In this talk we prove a duality relation between coalescence times and exit points in last-passage percolation models with exponential weights. As a consequence, we get lower bounds for coalescence times with scaling exponent 3/2, and we relate its distribution with variational problems involving the Brownian motion process and the Airy process.

                                approach that relies on stochastic domination arguments and leverages
                                from symmetry to employ well-known facts, we show the existence of
                                random regenerative space-time points on the trajectory of their
                                extremal particles.</p>

                        <p style='width:85%'> Abstract: We present some partial results on quantitative exponential convergence estimates for the renewal theorem when the inter arrival distribution has a uniform component and one finite exponential monent. We improve to that end the classic idea of coupling the age processes of a delayed renewal process and a non delayed one in order to get explicit estimates. A key element is our construcion of a coalescent coupling between two copies of the process that succeeds with at least some explicit probability which is independent of their initial relative delay. This construction and the computation of the lower bound rely on the use of the uniform component to couple inter arrival lengths with small enough "shifted" of those random variables. A second element is the study of a biased random walk associated with two independent copies of the process, which allows us to obtain, via Lyapunov and martingale techniques, an estimate of the total elapsed time required to observe renewals of the two copies within a time-interval of (large enough) prescribed length. Based on joint work in progress with Jean-Baptiste Bardet and Alejandra Christen.</p>
